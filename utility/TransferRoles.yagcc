	Custom Command to transfer a member's roles to another member


	Trigger type: Regex
	Trigger: `\A(-|<@!?204255221017214977>\s*)((m(ove)?|tr(ansfer)?)r(oles)?)(\s+|\z)`
	Errors as Custom Command Outputs: off

	Usage:
	-transferroles <@user/ID> <@user/ID>

	This command makes YAGPDB remove all roles from the second member and gives them all roles from the first member specified.
	It can not transfer:
	- Roles above or equal to the bot's highest role
	- Roles manages by integrations (Bot roles, Booster roles, Twitch roles etc.)

	NOTE: This may error if you are transferring more than 60 roles.

	Feel free to ping me in YAGPDB support or DM me if you have any questions or problems!
